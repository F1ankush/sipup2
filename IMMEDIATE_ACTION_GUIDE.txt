## 📁 Files Involved

### New Smart System Files:
```
includes/config_manager.php    ← Smart detection logic
setup_wizard.php               ← Beautiful setup interface
config_api.php                 ← API for wizard
.db_config                     ← Auto-saved credentials (hidden)
```

### Updated Files:
```
includes/config.php            ← Now uses smart system
includes/db.php                ← Now has fallback logic
```

## ✨ Why This Works

### Problem Before:
```
Someone sets wrong password → Website crashes → User has to fix manually
```

### Solution Now:
```
Wrong password → Auto-detection tries all combinations → Uses one that works → Saves it → Website works forever
```

---

## 🎓 How It Works (Simple Version)

When you open your website:

1. **Check Saved Config**
   - Is there a `.db_config` file?
   - Can we connect with it?
   - ✅ YES → Use it and load website

2. **Auto-Detect Credentials** (if saved config doesn't work)
   - Try: root + empty password
   - Try: root + Karan@1903
   - Try: b2b_billing_system + empty password
   - Try: b2b_billing_system + Karan@1903
   - ✅ One of these works → Save it and load website

3. **Show Setup Wizard** (if all fail)
   - Redirect to setup wizard
   - User enters correct credentials manually
   - ✅ Save and load website

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Will this affect my existing data?
**A:** No! This system only manages connections. All your data is safe.

### Q: What if I change the password later?
**A:** Just visit setup wizard again. It will auto-detect or let you enter new password.

### Q: Is this secure?
**A:** Yes! Credentials saved with restricted file permissions (0600).

### Q: Do I need to do anything else?
**A:** Nope! Just start MySQL and refresh. Everything else is automatic.

### Q: Will it work if someone changes config.php?
**A:** Yes! System checks `.db_config` first, which overrides config.php.
