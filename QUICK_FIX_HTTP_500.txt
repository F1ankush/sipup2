## 🆘 If Still Not Working

**99% of the time, it's one of these:**

1. **Database doesn't exist**
   - Go to Hostinger → MySQL Databases
   - Create database named `b2bsystem`

2. **Database is empty (no tables)**
   - Upload `database_schema.sql` via phpMyAdmin
   - This creates all required tables

3. **Wrong credentials in .db_config**
   - Delete `.db_config` file
   - Go to setup_database.php and re-enter credentials
   - Re-test the connection

4. **File permissions**
   - .db_config should have 644 permissions
   - uploads/ folder should have 755 permissions
